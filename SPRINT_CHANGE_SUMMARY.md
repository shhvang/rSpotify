- Line count parameter: 10-500 lines supported
- Large logs (>3000 chars) sent as document files

**Testing:**
```bash
# Test on production VPS after deployment completes
/logs          # Get last 50 lines

/errorlogs     # Get error logs
```

### ✅ 3. Enhance /ping with Response Timings - COMPLETED
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and deployed  
**Commit:** d742976

**Features:**
- Database response time measurement
- Telegram API response time measurement
- Total response time calculation
- All timings displayed in milliseconds
- Non-breaking change - maintains existing /ping behavior

**Example Output:**
```
🏓 Pong!

👋 Hello John!
🤖 Bot is running and responsive
🗄️ Database: ✅ Connected
⚡ Environment: production

⏱️ Response Timings:
• Database: 45.23ms

• Telegram API: 123.45ms
• Total: 178.92ms

Use /help for available commands.
```

**Files Modified:**
- `rspotify_bot/bot.py` - Enhanced ping_command with timing logic

---

### ✅ 4. OAuth Local Development Guide - COMPLETED (Updated with shhvang.space Domain)
**Status:** ✅ Created and optimized  
**Location:** `rSpotify/docs/development/OAUTH_LOCAL_TESTING.md`

**Architecture:**
- Production: `rspotify.shhvang.space` → VPS (178.128.48.130)
- Development: `rspotifytest.shhvang.space` → Local machine OR ngrok
- **Key Benefit:** VPS IP changes no longer require Spotify app updates - just update DNS A record!

**Contents:**
- DNS configuration for prod/dev subdomains (using shhvang.space domain)
- Two dev options: ngrok (recommended, no router config) OR port forwarding (persistent)
- Removed DuckDNS entirely (no longer needed with owned domain)
- Production SSL setup with Let's Encrypt
- Spotify app configuration for multiple environments
- Complete testing checklist
- 8 common issues with detailed solutions
- Security notes specific to domain-based setup
- PowerShell commands for Windows development
- Development vs Production .env examples

**Why This Approach is Better:**
- ✅ Professional branded URLs (no DuckDNS or random ngrok URLs)
- ✅ Persistent production URL (VPS IP changes don't affect Spotify)
- ✅ Dual environment isolation (completely separate prod/dev)
- ✅ No third-party DNS dependencies (full control)
- ✅ GitHub Actions simplicity (just update DEPLOY_HOST secret if IP changes)

**Use Case:** Developers can test Story 1.4 (Spotify OAuth) locally with professional domain setup, and production remains stable even when VPS IP changes

---

## Deployment Status

**Code Deployment:** ✅ LIVE on Production VPS (commit d742976)

**GitHub Actions:** Running  
- Monitor: https://github.com/shhvang/rSpotify/actions

**Expected Deployment Time:** ~2-3 minutes

**What's Deployed:**
1. rSpotify bot with new commands
2. Better Than Very bot (web app)
3. Perfect Circle bot (web app)

---

## Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Code Testing ✅ (In Progress)
**After deployment completes (~2 min):**

1. **Test /logs command:**
   ```
   Send: /logs
   Expected: Receive last 50 lines of bot logs
   
   Send: /logs 100
   Expected: Receive last 100 lines
   ```

2. **Test /errorlogs command:**
   ```
   Send: /errorlogs
   Expected: "No errors recorded" OR error log content
   ```

3. **Test /ping timings:**
   ```
   Send: /ping
   Expected: Two messages showing:
   - Bot status + Database time
   - Telegram API time + Total time
   ```

4. **Test /help update:**
   ```
   Send: /help
   Expected: Shows /logs and /errorlogs in owner commands section
   ```

### Phase 2: Documentation Updates (Pending)
- Update PRD NFR16
- Update Architecture Section 8
- Update Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
- Update README.md

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Log file paths wrong on VPS | 🟢 Low | Using standard `/opt/rspotify-bot/logs/` path |
| Large logs crash bot | 🟢 Low | Limited to 500 lines max, >3000 chars sent as document |
| Timing adds latency to /ping | 🟢 None | Measurements are microseconds, negligible |
| OAuth guide outdated | 🟢 Low | Will update during Story 1.4 implementation |
| Breaking changes | 🟢 None | All changes are additive enhancements |

**Overall:** ✅ All changes successfully implemented with minimal risk
